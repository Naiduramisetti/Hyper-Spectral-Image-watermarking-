# 🌈 Hyper-Spectral Image Watermarking

## 📖 Abstract
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) faces challenges in preserving data integrity while embedding ownership markers, as existing watermarking techniques often struggle to balance security and image quality, leading to potential degradation in hyperspectral data usability.  

To address this, we introduce a **secure watermarking framework** specifically designed for HSI, ensuring both image integrity and ownership preservation while maintaining practical usability.  

Our system includes:
- **Preprocessing**: Noise suppression, normalization, and automated band selection.  
- **Watermarking Strategies**: DWT-DCT, DFT, spread spectrum, and overlay techniques.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: PSNR, SSIM, and watermark retention rate to assess both image quality and protection effectiveness.  

🔬 Experimental results show the framework **safeguards hyperspectral data** without degrading its quality. We also analyze the impact on classification and target detection to ensure minimal disruption, confirming the pipeline’s viability for both research and real-world applications.
